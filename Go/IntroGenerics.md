## [GopherCon 2021: Robert Griesemer & Ian Lance Taylor - Generics!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa_e9EeCdy8)

### Guidance

- DON'T start writing code by defining type paramater constraints on a function 
- First write a function with a specific type and then evaluate if to be made generic - 
- Use generics only where lot of common code exsits



### When to use type-parameter based Generics:

 Situations 	

- Boilerplate code which looks the same, just input/output types are different 	
- Any general logic which is largely independent of the typ -
